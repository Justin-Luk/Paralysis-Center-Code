## Description

This program requires a completed compilation video. It is possible that this will not always be the case and at some point, a raw video file could be utilized, if additional functionality is added in the future. The user will be able to navigate through the compilation, frame by frame if desired, and select a frame to measure angles on. Additional lines, arrows, shapes, etc can be added to the chosen frame. Once the user is satisfied, the frame with all edits will be named and saved by hitting the save button.
